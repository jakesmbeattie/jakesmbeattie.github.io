## About Me
My name is Jacob (Jake) Beattie, and I am a Computer Science and Engineering PhD student at The Ohio State University. I have the wonderful pleasure of being advised by [Dr. Tanya Berger-Wolf](https://cse.osu.edu/people/berger-wolf.1) and contributing to the [Imageomics Institute](https://imageomics.osu.edu/) and [AI and Biodiversity Change (ABC) Global Center](https://www.abcresearchcenter.org/about). 

I completed Bachelor's in both Computer Science and Mathematics at Iowa State University in 2023 (go Cyclones!).

My research is focused on using advances in AI theory to motivate new methods that allow for more effective scientific discovery.

## Updates

<ul>
<li>06/2025 - I will be attending CVPR from 06/11 - 06/15 in Nashville! Stop by CV4Animals to say hi and take a look at our poster :)</li>
<li>05/2025 - <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GJBsEcx_ZZzJaY_Rv_LZgIV8LsowlYJR/view">Habitat-Driven Vocal Variation in Hawai'ian Birds</a>, a paper that I helped write, was accepted into the CV4Animals workshop at CVPR! </li>
<li>01/2025 - I travelled to Hawai'i as part of the <i>Experiential Introduction to AI and Ecology course</i>. Over two weeks (and with the massive help of <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/">NEON</a> staff and UH Hilo's <a href="https://lohelab.org/">Pat Hart and Amanda Navine</a>), we collected some pretty awesome acoustic data on Hawai'ian birds.</li>

## Research
Over the course of my PhD (and beyond), my goal is to find some fundamental (and hopefully quite cool) observation about how ML models learn/structure their latent spaces, and leverage this observation to accelerate ecological research and scientific discovery. To this end, I have already begun to work with incredible ecologists and biologists through the Imageomics Institute and the ABC Global Center. On the horizon, I have some projects that begin to work towards these theoretical observations as well.

### Papers
Papers that I am particularly proud of and that encapsulate my overall research contributions well (currently exhaustive)

## Extra Bits
In my free time, I enjoy baking. If you happen to live in Columbus, OH, and desperately want a homemade loaf of bread, I can make one for you (in exchange for a few bucks for a poor grad student).
